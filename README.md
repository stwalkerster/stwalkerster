Hi! I'm Simon, known across the internet as `stwalkerster`. I'm a cloud engineer in my day job, and an open source developer and homelab hobbyist in my free time.

I'm the primary maintainer of three open-source projects - [Helpmebot](https://helpmebot.org.uk) ([source](https://github.com/helpmebot/helpmebot)), Wikipedia's Account Creation Assistance tool ("WACA", or [WP:ACC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ACC); [source](https://github.com/enwikipedia-acc/waca)), and [EyeInTheSky](https://eyeinthesky.im) ([source](https://github.com/stwalkerster/eyeinthesky)), amongst numerous smaller projects which don't see much use. I've also contributed to a number of other open source projects where I've seen something interesting to fix.
